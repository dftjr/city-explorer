# Project Name

**Author**: David Tusia

**Version**: 1.0.8

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

This App allowsanyone form the client side to request a bunch of data based on the city they input into the search bar. This pulls API data from 3 different sites that will then give the user a view of 3 things:

- Current weather forecast
- A map showing the location
- Movies that are based on the area which was selected

This app allows the user of the site to enter a location in the United States and get the exact coordinates coordinates (and other potential information in the future).

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

**STEP 1:** Git copy the file to your local machine if testing locally, link is here: [Front-End Server](https://github.com/dftjr/city-explorer.git)
(Heroku and Netlify are currently NOT working, please run code from localhost:3000

**STEP 2:** Please have API keys ready in order to pull the informtion from the server. You can get the keys for free from the following links below:

[TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)

[Weatherbit](https://www.weatherbit.io/)

[LocationIQ](https://my.locationiq.com/dashboard/login?ref=locationiq#demo)

**STEP 3:** Git copy the back-end code, link is here: [Back-End App](https://github.com/dftjr/city-explorer-api.git)

**STEP 4:** You should be good to go, Happy hacking!

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

- Using the following languages: JS, CSS, HTML
Importing the following: Express, Dotnev, Cors, Netlify, Heroku

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2021 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->

8-22-2022 1:30am - Application is now setup to run React, Axios, and Bootstrap. Starting build, site under construction.

8-22-2022 5:00pm - LocationIQ connected to API. 

8-23-2022 8:00pm - Cards created. Maps displaying.

8-25-2022 10:00am - All query items properly being sent to the back-end.

8-26-2022 10:00am - Cleaned up the component files, restructure some code.

8-2-2022 10:00am - Cache data is saving after client-side searches, data cached now populating faster

8-24-2022 10:00am - Displaying data from API. Error code message updated.
